 The pgiven dataset is Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. 
 I imported the necessary libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.I dataset is loaded using Pandas and column names are assigned to the dataframe. 
 Then I preprocessed the dataset by separating the features and target variable. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the features are scaled using 
 StandardScaler. I used Logistic Regression  model and gradient boosting classifier and trained on the scaled training data, and predictions are made on the test data. 
 Then i calculated the accuracy of the model and also generated a  classification report, providing detailed evaluation metrics.
